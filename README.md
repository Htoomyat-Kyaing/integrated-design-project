# Employee Management System (Integrated Project)

This is a web application that I developed as an assignment project during my 5th year, 2nd semester of university. It is built with,

- React with Vite (Typescript), Tailwind CSS for frontend

- Mamba UI and Daisy UI for UI, and

- Supabase for backend and user authentication.
 
It provides a user-friendly interface for managing employees and related information. Currently, it is being deployed on Netlify. You can check it here! -  [https://integrated-design-project.netlify.app](https://integrated-design-project.netlify.app/)

## Features

- **Employee Information**: Maintain a database of employee details, including their names, age, and positions.
- **Employee Directory**: Easily search, filter, and sort employees based on various criteria.
- **Leave Management**: Track and manage employee attendance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/Htoomyat-Kyaing/integrated-design-project.git`
2. Install dependencies: `cd integrated-design-project` and run `npm install`
3. Set up Supabase: Follow the Supabase documentation to create an account and set up your Supabase project. Then [create tables](#creating-tables), and insert rows accordingly.
4. [Configure](#configuration) environment variables: Create a `.env` file in the project root and provide the necessary environment variables, such as Supabase credentials.
5. Start the development server: Run `npm run dev` to start the application in development mode.

## <a name="creating-tables">Creating Tables

After setting up your own database in supabase, you'll need to create 2 tables called "employees" and "records".

- SQL for creating "employees" table

`create table
  public.employees (
    id bigint generated by default as identity not null,
    first_name text null,
    last_name text null,
    age smallint null,
    position text null,
    today boolean not null default false,
    constraint Employee _pkey primary key (id)
  ) tablespace pg_default;`

- SQL for creating "records" table

`create table
  public.records (
    id bigint generated by default as identity not null,
    created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
    employee_id bigint not null,
    status boolean not null,
    constraint record_pkey primary key (id),
    constraint records_employee_id_fkey foreign key (employee_id) references employees (id) on delete cascade
  ) tablespace pg_default;`

Make sure to grant all access for users (insert,update,read,delete) in RLS policies (or) simply just disable RLS policies.

## <a name="configuration">Configuration

To configure the application, you'll need to set the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: The URL of your Supabase project.
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: The API key for your Supabase project.

Make sure to provide valid Supabase credentials to ensure proper integration with the backend.

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`. You'll be able to navigate through the different sections of the Employee Management System and perform the desired operations.
